# Fastify Mongodb REST API

Inspired by [FatzWeb MERN Stack con Context API (Subida de imagenes, TailwindCSS, Formik)](https://github.com/FaztWeb/mern-context-crud)

## MERN Context

This is a MERN Stack Application CRUD with image upload using React Hook useContext

### Considerations

-   Backend: http://localhost:4000
-   Frontend: http://localhost:3000

The frontend will be served from the backend in production, but in development it will be served using a proxy

## Cloduinary

This application uses Cloudinary as Image Hosting, so you need to provide the following environment variables. You can find this on your Cloudinary's profile

-   CLOUD_NAME
-   API_KEY
-   API_SECRET

## Mongodb

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/merndb
